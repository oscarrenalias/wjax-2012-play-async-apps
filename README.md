This repository contains the presentation and code that I will utilize in my presentation in WJAX Munich 2012: http://it-republik.de/konferenzen/ext_scripts/v2/php/sessions-popup.php?module=wjax2012&id=23547

Sample code
===========
There are three sample Play applications showing different capabilities of the Play Framework, but they're all centered around asynchronous response handling and reactive IO:

* play-async-basic - Basic HTTP request handling capabilities
* play-reactive - Play's reactive IO capabilities
* play-websockets - WebSockets in Play
